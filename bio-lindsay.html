          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Today, Dr. James Orleans – Lindsay ranks among Ghana’s most
              cherished business leaders, employing hundreds, and engineered
              corporate accomplishments across construction, advertising,
              security, supplies, consultancy et cetera.He’s CEO of a dozen
              companies —most prominently, JL Properties, which is responsible
              for transforming the one time Achimota dumpsite/ quarry into
              easily the cleanest estate in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hailing from Cape Coast, Orleans – Lindsay traces his ancestry to
              an illustrious family tree of firsts; including Birempong Cudjo,
              credited with first bringing settlers to a town called Sew Do
              —where he is said to have tricked European merchants into
              believing that slaves he was supposed to have brought them had all
              perished by erecting faux graves at the area (which loosely
              translates from Fante as “small hill”) to corroborate his alibi.
              Cudjo’s son is the great Philip Quarcoe (1741 – 1816) —among the
              first Fante boys to be taken to England for training as
              missionaries, the first from the Gold Coast to receive formal
              education, the first to be ordained minister by the Anglican
              church, and the first to establish a school in the Gold Coast.
            </p>
            <p>
              Orleans – Lindsay is alumnus of Madonna School (Koforidua), St.
              Peter’s Secondary School (Nkwatia), St Augustine’s College (Cape
              Coast), Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology
              (KNUST), Master Of Science (MSc) in Construction Management; 2000
              (University Of Salford), Doctor of Philosophy in Construction
              Management; 2004 (University Of Hertfordshire) and Certification
              Program in Real Estates Finance (The London School of Economics
              and Political Science – LSE; 2022).
            </p>
            <p>
              For him, majority of the schools he attended growing up, not only
              catered to his intellectual capabilities, but also molded him into
              a green thumb by the sheer beauty of the landscapes they were set
              in. This peculiar affection for the environment, expresses itself
              now —in the estates he develops— as it did for him in his
              university days, when he cultivated vegetable gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
              He could have been a medical doctor. Indeed, he studied the
              subject for a bit —mainly to honor his grandfather, who was a
              doctor, and owned a hospital in Kumasi. The expectation at the
              time — a peculiarly Ghanaian one at that —was to see him enter a
              prestigious vocation, and ensure that he had a job for life, as
              the doors hospital were always open to him to practice in. The
              fact that he excelled in the Sciences became an even bigger
              catalyst for him being pressured to read Medicine. But he would
              quickly learn, that having interest overrides being good, and that
              doing things for fulfilment, is always the best way—and it’s what
              he’s done for the past twenty years. Several times, he’s been
              advised to try this or try that, but he has kept his focus, and
              will not be moved. “My interest is here!”
            </p>
            <p>
              The passion has paid off —JL Properties are now “The City’s
              Favorite Developer,”A well-travelled man who has had stints at
              High Speed Production Wandswort (London), IBM (UK), J.O.L Limited,
              and Netlynk Kea Systems, his extensive experience has ensured that
              he has engaged with wealth —the dogma and the reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              His portfolio is rich. Aside being Executive Chairman of JL
              Holdings, Orleans – Lindsay is president of Ghana Association of
              Young Entrepreneurs, Contributor for Top African Managing
              Directors selected for the best practice by the United Nations
              Ref., member of the Ghana France Chamber of Commerce, the Ghana-UK
              Chamber of Commerce, Commonwealth Business Council, and was
              personally invited by former Mozambican president, Joaquin Alberto
              Chissano to the country’s Investment Conference. A CAF Coaching
              certificate ‘A’ holder, Orleans – Lindsay is a one-time board
              member of Accra Hearts of Oak.
            </p>
            <p>
              He holds that entrepreneurship is the key to bringing financial
              freedom to this country — not government employment, and adamant
              that everybody who has been entrusted with some wealth, owes it
              back to the society; a key reason for his fervent activity in
              philanthropic ventures across football, women, children, among
              others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. James Orleans – Lindsay is clear on what his legacy will be.
              Beyond sharing his wealth equally with charity, and cementing his
              name further in estate development, he intends to mentor 100, 000
              burgeoning entrepreneurs.
